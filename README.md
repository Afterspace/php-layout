## PHPLayout - What is this?
A very simple approach to handle page layouts with Core PHP.

## How do i use this?
Im presenting the approach publicly - you are welcome to use the same approach to your project,
by having a class that will load your page with the given parameters of "layout", "page", and "pageParams";

This is not a redirect and/or Router type of thing, its just an approach to handle loading of pages with certain
predefined layouts.
